# Odin Project - Landing Page

## Goal

To create an entire web page from a design provided by TheOdinProject's curriculum.

## Requirements

- Get your project as close as you can to the design, but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect.
- Don’t get out your ruler or count pixels to find the exact margins between the various sections.
- The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.
